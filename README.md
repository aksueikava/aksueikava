<h3 align="center">Fullstack Developer, Integration Developer, API Developer, Prompt Engineer, and AI Researcher.</h3>

I am Watashi o y≈´waku suru aka(also known as) aksueikava, a Fullstack Developer from the üåç **Russian Federation**. Despite my self-deprecating humor, I'm deeply involved in software development & web design, and I assure you, I write very type-safe code.

Aside from my development expertise, I engage in UX/UI design, creating interactive and visually elegant websites. In my downtime, I explore artificial intelligence, always seeking innovative ways to integrate AI technologies into my work and have fun with new coding challenges.

I mainly use the .NET ecosystem but I'm fine with other tech' aswell. My thing is mostly backend and pure software programming. I also like doing some reverse engineering things and also making scripts to make my life easier.

As a fervent Next.js enthusiast, an anime enjoyer, and a contributor to numerous repositories I adore, I'm constantly exploring my passions and expanding my horizons.
